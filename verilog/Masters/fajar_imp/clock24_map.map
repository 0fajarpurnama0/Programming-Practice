WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB LED<1> is either not constrained (LOC) to
   a specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
   I/O Standard.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
